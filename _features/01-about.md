Severe political polarization has serious impacts on society, ranging from legislative gridlock to violence like the storming of the US capitol. Our team aims to measure and understand what causes polarization and how it changes over time, particularly in relation to social media. By bringing together experts from both computer science and political science, we are using and developing cutting-edge algorithms, guided and validated by domain expertise. Combining these tools with large datasets we have collected, such as over 400 million tweets, we hope to shine new light on how polarization develops and evolves, and help society reduce adverse effects of hyperpolarization in the future.
